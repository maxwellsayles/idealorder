The files in the project perform statistical analysis of the order of ideal class groups of imaginary quadratic number fields.

That's a mouthful, I know.

---------------------------------

idealorder.gp can be used to generate data files of random ideal class groups and the factorization of their order. You will need Pari/GP to run this file.  It generates discriminants of random semiprimes of nbits.  Then for multipliers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 10, computes discriminants D = 0, 1 (mod 4) and for the first 5 prime ideals, computes the order and its factorization of the ideal class associated with the prime ideal representative.  

The format out the data file is:

n k p order success [factors]

where n is the nbit semiprime, k is the multiplier of the discriminant, p is the prime ideal representative, order is the order of the ideal class, success is whether the ideal class leads to an ambiguous ideal class that leads to the factorization of the semiprime n, and [factors] are the factorization of order.

---------------------------------

The "haskell" folder contains various Haskell modules useful for statistical queries of the data files generated by idealorder.gp.

---------------------------------

The cc folder contains C++11 sources files for statistical analysis of the data.  For large data files, the Haskell modules are too slow and require too much memory.  The C++11 sources are faster and have a smaller memory footprint, but are not as nice to work with.

Some of the analysis done includes:

- What ratio of the orders are smooth with respect to specific prime powers?
- Suppose the order of an ideal class is known, how many factors need to be added to its factorization for it to be a multiple of the order of another ideal class (ideal classes are the first 5 prime ideal representatives).
- Assuming we know the order of the first prime ideal, how many ideals need to be tried before a successful factorization of the integer n associated with the discriminant.
